- Each component must reside in its own folder named after the component, e.g., [ComponentName].
- Inside each component folder, the main component file must be named index.tsx.
- Each component folder must include a Storybook file named [ComponentName].stories.tsx.
- Each component folder must have a test file named [ComponentName].test.tsx.
- Each component folder must include a type definitions file named [ComponentName].types.ts.
- Components that are specific to pages or views and are not core should be placed inside the corresponding Views components folder.
- Core components (i.e., general-purpose components that can be used across views, such as inputs, accordions, etc.) should be placed under src/Components/Core.
- Components should export all public interfaces and helpers from index.tsx for easy imports.
- All components should include TypeScript types/interfaces for props and optionally JSDoc comments.
