- Utilize TypeScript's features to ensure type safety.
- Prefer interfaces over types when defining object shapes.
- Always add an "I" in front of an interface name, e.g. interface IUser
- Use generics to create reusable components and functions.
- Enforce strict typing and avoid 'any' type as much as possible.
